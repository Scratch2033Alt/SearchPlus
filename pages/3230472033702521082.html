                    W3C has created Community and Business Groups to meet
                    the needs of a growing community of Web stakeholders.
                    Community Groups enable anyone to socialize their ideas for
                    the Web at the W3C for possible future standardization.
                    Business Groups provide companies anywhere in the world
                    with access to the expertise and community needed to
                    develop open Web technology. New W3C Working Groups can
                    then build mature Web standards on top of best of the
                    experimental work, and businesses and other organizations
                    can make the most out of W3C's Open Web
                    Platform in their domain of interest.

        </h2>
                                <p>The mission of the Accessibility at the Edge Community Group is to examine improvements to internet accessibility via "edge computing", a relatively new paradigm that focuses on performing tasks at the edge of the network. Unlike cloud computing, edge computing emphasizes activities that occur closer to the user; these could include accessibility oriented user-agent extensions, applications on content delivery networks, JavaScript-enabled capabilities, AI or ML. The group is a forum for discussing both currently available products, potentially new applications not yet commercially available, as well as objective measures of the quality of any one of these. Our tasks can include inventorying both opportunities and challenges, drafting and incubating Internet specifications for further assessment, standardization, prototyping and testing of reference implementations. A11Y-EDGE CG meetings work and operate under the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/code-of-conduct/">W3C Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility (COGA) Task Force</li>
<li>The Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (AG)</li>
</ul>

<p>Scope
The Accessibility Internationalization Community Group will include the following efforts:
</p>

<li>Improve the internationalization of COGA  and AG publications.</li>
<li>Develop criteria and tests for easy-to-understand language in different languages.</li>
<li>Develop criteria and tests for text appearance and semantics in different writing systems</li>
<li>Develop criteria and tests for additional guidance that changes based on additional language, writing system, or culture.</li>
</ul>

<p>The community group’s initial focus is to help internationalize two accessibility resources that are currently in development:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The next version of Making Content Usable for People with Cognitive and Learning Disabilities </li>
<li>WCAG 3.0, with two guidelines as the top priorities: “Clear Language” and “Text Appearance and Semantics,” which will have tests and criteria in different languages.</li>

        </h2>
                                <p>The ACT Rules Community Group (previously known as Auto-WCAG), is an open forum set up to document and harmonise the interpretation of W3C accessibility standards, such as WCAG and WAI-ARIA, for testing purposes.</p>

<p>The ACT Rules Community Group (ACT-R) achieves this by bringing together the people developing, implementing and using various accessibility testing tools and methodologies to document interpretations as test rules. Test rules are defined using the ACT Rules Format, and reviewed by the community. The process of researching, documenting, and sharing knowledge from different perspectives within the group, builds towards a common understanding. Publishing rules is not an end point for harmonization, it's a starting point. By publishing such test rules, ACT-R hopes to motivate organisations to share their own insights, and encourage adoption of commonly agreed test rules.</p>

<p>ACT-R is not set up to remove differences or impose changes on accessibility testing tools and methodologies. There is value in innovation and diverse approaches. Rather it aims to contribute to more consistent results, regardless of how the testing is done. Knowing when something meets a requirement, and when it does not, should be clear and consistent. </p>

        </h2>
                                <p>The mission of the AI Agent Protocol Community Group is to develop open, interoperable protocols that enable AI agents to discover, identify, and collaborate efficiently across the Web. As AI agents increasingly participate in Web-based activities, there is a growing need for standardized mechanisms to support secure, reliable, and scalable interactions. This group aims to establish the technical foundations for the emerging Agentic Web. The AI Agent Protocol Community Group would like to bring together industry and academia stakeholders interested in standardizing agent communication.</p>

<h4>Scope of Work</h4>

<p>This Community Group will explore and define:</p>

<ul>
<li>Inter-agent communication protocols: Mechanisms that allow agents to discover one another, exchange intent and capability information, negotiate roles, and dynamically establish or dissolve collaborations in an open Web environment.</li>
<li>Agent identity models: An identity framework for AI agents, based on open standards, to support secure, interoperable authentication between agents across domains.</li>
<li>Standardized metadata formats: Structured descriptions of agent capabilities, interfaces, goals, and states, based on Web-native formats to enable automated reasoning, composition, and orchestration of agent behavior.</li>
<li>Security and privacy mechanisms: Cross-origin communication security models for agents, including authentication, authorization, verifiable credential-based trust, and end-to-end encryption, to safeguard the integrity and confidentiality of agent interactions.</li>
<li>Protocol interoperability: Compatibility layers and best practices that allow agent-based systems to leverage existing Web protocols and standards for integration and collaboration.</li>
</ul>

<p>This group will publish Specifications.</p>

<p>This group welcomes participation from AI platform developers, protocol designers, browser vendors, Web application developers, academic researchers, and other stakeholders interested in advancing the open standards that will enable a trusted, collaborative Web of agents.</p>

<h4>Who Should Join</h4>

<p>We welcome participation from individuals and organizations in the following areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>Developers of AI platforms and agent-based applications</li>
<li>Enterprise software and infrastructure providers</li>
<li>Academic and research institutions</li>
<li>Standards bodies and open source organizations</li>
<li>Policymakers and regulatory agencies</li>
</ul>

<p>Join the AI Agent Protocol Web Community Group to co-develop open technologies that enhance the interoperability and security of AI agents—and help build a trustworthy, collaborative, and global agent network for the Web.</p>

                                <p>How WAI-ARIA is supported by assistive technologies, such as screen readers,  is highly variable. This variation in WAI-ARIA rendering adds unnecessary complexity to the development of high-quality web experiences for users of assistive technologies and places significant limitations on the types of web widgets that can be made widely accessible.</p>

<p>This community group is dedicated to:</p>

<p>1.  helping assistive technology developers converge on a set of clear norms for baseline support of WAI-ARIA.
2. Helping web developers understand the current state of support for WAI-ARIA by assistive technologies.</p>

<p>WAI-ARIA is as important to assistive technology presentation as CSS is to visual presentation. Join us to help make WAI-ARIA as reliable as CSS.</p>

                Audiovisual Media Formats for Browsers Community Group            </a>
        </h2>
                                <p>Over the past decade, a growing number of sound and imaging media formats have been established offering increasingly sophisticated user experiences such as High Dynamic Range (HDR) and Spatial Audio. On the imaging side, these media formats provide the technical means to facilitate increased spatial and temporal resolutions, higher bit depths, as well as varying color volumes and the mapping between them. Similarly, on the audio side, higher bit-depth, sample rates and more immersive surround sound and speech processing options are available.
These experiences are facilitated through tools and technical mechanisms available to both professional and consumer content providers and are readily available for linear content types. However, options to provide such experiences through the web are still limited as potential solutions are fragmented and often insular or significantly limited in capabilities among open source as well as proprietary options. This typically results in incorrect presentation to an end user or even error messages. 
Therefore, there is need to consider how to support modern audiovisual formats in a W3C context. To alleviate friction in development and deployment, it seems highly beneficial to our community to synchronize open and proprietary solutions so that they can co-exist within a W3C framework. The scope of this community group is to provide a forum for those discussions.

This community group will complement the work of the ISO/TC 323 on CE standardisation, with discussions from a technical and web-focused perspective.</p>

<p>The group will primarily be a discussion group, but may in the future decide to produce reports or other deliverables. This group will not publish Specifications. Starting out, the group will discuss the requirements set by the CE and DPPs on web technologies and standards, to identify standardisation challenges that are not yet met. Group members will share ideas, experiences and thoughts on usage of web technologies in these areas, their strengths and weaknesses, and open challenges — for instance in the form of use cases. </p>

<p>For this community group we welcome all parties interested in the technical aspects of CE, and DPP implementation. We envision that participants either have knowledge and expertise on CE and DPPs, e.g. material flows, manufacturing, modelling, or business aspects, so they are able to, for instance, contribute use cases, needs, and test scenarios. Additionally, we welcome participants with knowledge and expertise on web infrastructure, technologies, and standards who are interested in applying their expertise to address CE-related challenges.</p>

                Cloud-Edge-Client Coordination Community Group            </a>
        </h2>
                                <p>1. Goals
The mission of this group is to explore mechanisms and interfaces between Cloud, Edge, and Client for computing workload offloading and orchestration. The typical use cases include AI acceleration, cloud gaming, and streaming acceleration. The goal is to explore the feasibility of defining a set of new APIs and mechanisms that enable computing workload offloading and orchestration between Cloud, Edge, and Client. It should leverage existing mechanisms as much as possible and should coordinate with related W3C working groups and other SDOs and open-source communities if necessary.</p>

<p>
2. Scope of Work
This group aims to discuss proposals for Cloud-Edge-Client coordination, including:
- Use cases and requirements for Cloud-Edge-Client coordination
- Proposals for APIs and mechanisms (including protocols) that enable computing workload offloading and orchestration between Cloud, Edge, and Client
- Secure networking and trust model requirements in the context of edge computing and offload to edge.</p>

<p>3. Out of Scope
The following are out of scope:
Actual development of standards.</p>

<p>4. Success Criteria
The Group will have succeeded if it can achieve the following:</p>

<p>- Participation from various stakeholder communities, especially from startups and innovators in the space of distributed computing;
- Consensus on a standard solution architecture for workload offloading.</p>

<p>5. Deliverables
Work items can be documents, such as specifications, technical reports, best practices and guidelines, use cases and requirements, white papers, etc. Work items can also be software, for instance test suites, samples, proof of concept work, etc. In general, all work items in scope of the group are welcome. If there are individuals who will commit to being editors for a document, the group should record agreement to accept it as a work item even if it conflicts with previous work adopted by the community. Newly-accepted work items that extend beyond the scope of this Community Group Charter will lead to a reconsideration of the Charter. The Community Group may vote to revise the Charter in order to include new work, or to determine that the proposed work is unrelated.</p>

<p>6. Specifications
The group may produce Specifications that are not on the W3C Standards track. Development of W3C Standards should be done in appropriate Working Groups.</p>

<p>7. Non-Normative Reports
The group may produce other Community Group Reports within the scope of this charter that are not Specifications, for instance Techinal Reports, Use Cases, Requirements, Primers, White Papers, etc.</p>

<p>8. Test Suites and Other Software
The group MAY produce test suites to support the Specifications. Please see the GitHub LICENSE file for test suite contribution licensing information.</p>

<p>9. Dependencies or Liaisons
The group may collaborate with other relevant groups within W3C.</p>

<p>10. Community and Business Group Process
The group operates under the Community and Business Group Process. Terms in this Charter that conflict with those of the Community and Business Group Process are void.</p>

<p>As with other Community Groups, W3C seeks organizational licensing commitments under the W3C Community Contributor License Agreement (CLA). When people request to participate without representing their organization's legal interests, W3C will in general approve those requests for this group with the following understanding: W3C will seek and expect an organizational commitment under the CLA starting with the individual's first request to make a contribution to a group Deliverable. The section on Contribution Mechanics describes how W3C expects to monitor these contribution requests.</p>

<p>The W3C Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct applies to participation in this group.</p>

<p>11. Work Limited to Charter Scope
The group will not publish Specifications on topics other than those listed under Specifications above. See below for how to modify the charter.</p>

<p>12. Contribution Mechanics
Substantive Contributions to Specifications can only be made by Community Group Participants who have agreed to the W3C Community Contributor License Agreement (CLA). Specifications created in the Community Group must use the W3C Software and Document License. All other documents produced by the group should use that License where possible.</p>

<p>Community Group participants agree to make all contributions in the GitHub repo the group is using for the particular document. This may be in the form of a pull request (preferred), by raising an issue, or by adding a comment to an existing issue.</p>

<p>All Github repositories attached to the Community Group must contain a copy of the CONTRIBUTING and LICENSE files.</p>

<p>13. Transparency
The group will conduct all of its technical work in public. If the group uses GitHub, all technical work will occur in its GitHub repositories (and not in mailing list discussions). This is to ensure contributions can be tracked through a software tool.</p>

<p>Meetings may be restricted to Community Group participants, but a public summary or minutes must be posted to the group's public mailing list, or to a GitHub issue if the group uses GitHub.</p>

<p>14. Decision Process
If the decision policy is documented somewhere, update this section accordingly to link to it. This group will seek to make decisions where there is consensus. Groups are free to decide how to make decisions (e.g. Participants who have earned Committer status for a history of useful contributions assess consensus, or the Chair assesses consensus, or where consensus isn't clear there is a Call for Consensus [CfC] to allow multi-day online feedback for a proposed course of action). It is expected that participants can earn Committer status through a history of valuable contributions as is common in open source projects. After discussion and due consideration of different opinions, a decision should be publicly recorded (where GitHub is used as the resolution of an Issue). If substantial disagreement remains (e.g. the group is divided) and the group needs to decide an Issue in order to continue to make progress, the Committers will choose an alternative that had substantial support (with a vote of Committers if necessary). Individuals who disagree with the choice are strongly encouraged to take ownership of their objection by taking ownership of an alternative fork. This is explicitly allowed (and preferred to blocking progress) with a goal of letting implementation experience inform which spec is ultimately chosen by the group to move ahead with. Any decisions reached at any meeting are tentative and should be recorded in a GitHub Issue for groups that use GitHub and otherwise on the group's public mail list. Any group participant may object to a decision reached at an online or in-person meeting within 7 days of publication of the decision provided that they include clear technical reasons for their objection. The Chairs will facilitate discussion to try to resolve the objection according to this decision process.</p>

<p>It is the Chairs' responsibility to ensure that the decision process is fair, respects the consensus of the CG, and does not unreasonably favour or discriminate against any group participant or their employer.</p>

<p>15. Amendments to this Charter
The group can decide to work on a proposed amended charter, editing the text using the Decision Process described above. The decision on whether to adopt the amended charter is made by conducting a 30-day vote on the proposed new charter. The new charter, if approved, takes effect on either the proposed date in the charter itself, or 7 days after the result of the election is announced, whichever is later. A new charter must receive 2/3 of the votes cast in the approval vote to pass. The group may make simple corrections to the charter such as deliverable dates by the simpler group decision process rather than this charter amendment process. The group will use the amendment process for any substantive changes to the goals, scope, deliverables, decision process or rules for amending the charter.</p>

        </h2>
                                <p>The real world is frustratingly uncertain, incomplete and inconsistent. This is challenging for traditional approaches to information systems, and a new paradigm is needed that combines symbolic and statistical techniques, building upon decades of work in the cognitive sciences, and over 500 million years of natural selection. This will allow us to create cognitive agents that learn and reason based upon prior knowledge and past experience, and which can satisfy the need for, transparency in decision making, and continuous learning for adapting to ever changing needs. This community group will address opportunities for cognitive agents using graphs, statistics, rules and graph algorithms, starting with an amalgam of RDF and Property Graphs, together with Web architecture for cognitive databases.</p>

<p>More specifically, the Cognitive AI Community Group will work on use cases and requirements, demo's,  open source, and scaling experiments. For more details, see:</p>

                                <p>The mission of the W3C Credible Web Community Group is to help shift the Web toward more trustworthy content without increasing censorship or social division. We want users to be able to tell when content is reliable, accurate, and shared in good faith, and to help them steer away from deceptive content. At the same time, we affirm the need for users to find the content they want and to interact freely in the communities they choose. To balance any conflict between these goals, we are committed to providing technologies which keep end-users in control of their Web experience.</p>

<p>The group's primary strategy involves data sharing on the Web, in the style of schema.org, using existing W3C data standards like JSON-LD.  We believe significant progress toward our goals can be reached by properly specifying "credibility indicators", a vocabulary/schema for data about content and the surrounding ecosystem, which can help a person and/or machine decide whether a content item should be trusted.</p>

<p>The umbrella term "CSS3" was incredibly useful in teaching the new additions to CSS around 2010. It seems time to loosely group together more recent additions under another umbrella, to help increase adoption and make it easier to teach. This will not change how the CSSWG operates, will not affect spec numbering, and will be separate from the official CSS snapshots. </p>

<p>Discussion began at: https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/4770</p>

        </h2>
                                <p>The mission of the W3C Data Privacy Vocabularies and Controls CG (DPVCG) is to develop a taxonomy of privacy and data protection related terms, which include in particular terms from the new European <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a>, such as a taxonomy of personal data as well as a classification of purposes (i.e., purposes for data collection), and events of disclosures, consent, and processing such personal data.</p>

<p>The DPVCG was created as an outcome of the W3C Workshop on Data Privacy Controls and Vocabularies in Vienna in 2017, and started on 25th May 2018 – the date of the enforcement of GDPR. Since then, the DPVCG has worked to fulfil its aims and objectives, and produced the <a href="https://www.w3.org/ns/dpv">Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV)</a> as a deliverable. </p>

<p>Membership to the group is open to all interested individuals and organisations. To join the group, you need a valid W3C account – which is free to get and can be <a href="https://www.w3.org/accounts/request">requested here</a>. The group meets usually through online meeting calls, details of which, including past minutes, can be <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/dpvcg/wiki/Meeting_Calls">found here</a>. The group also interacts through a <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-dpvcg/">mailing list</a> regarding topics, discussions, sharing of agendas, actions, and other relevant items. The resources and work relevant to the group is hosted on the <a href="https://github.com/dpvcg/">GitHub platform under the DPVCG name</a>.</p>

<p>The group is currently chaired by:</p>

For past work, actions, issues, and records – please refer to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/dpvcg/wiki/">wiki</a> and threads on the <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-dpvcg/">mailing list</a>. Anyone can use the <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-dpvcg/">mailing list</a> to ask questions, suggest topics, raise issues, and offer solutions. Non-members might receive an automated reply asking them to authenticate their email or email address for posting.</p>

<p>Similarly, calls are usually open to attend, with the agenda shared on the public mailing list. Call details may be shared on the internal mailing lists accessible to only members for security purposes – so it may be best to ask the chair(s) or a member for attending a call.</p>

<p>General questions regarding what the group considers in scope can be determined from the aims and objectives. Specific queries or propositions should be conveyed to the mailing list. For issues regarding the DPV, including addition of concepts or a query or other relevant topics – you can use the mailing list or the issues feature in a <a href="https://github.com/dpvcg/">GitHub repo</a>.</p>

<h2>Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV)</h2>

<p>The DPV is a vocabulary (terms) and an ontology (relationships) serialised using semantic-web standards to represent concepts associated with privacy and data protection, primarily derived from GDPR. It enables representation of which <em>personal data categories</em> are undergoing a what kind of <em>processing</em> by a specific <em>data controller</em> and/or transferred to some <em>recipient</em> for a particular <em>purpose</em>, based on a specific <em>legal basis</em> (e.g., consent, or other legal grounds such as legitimate interest, etc.), with specified <em>technical and organisational measures and restrictions</em> (e.g., storage locations and storage durations) in place.</p>

<p>The DPV is useful as a machine-readable representation of personal data processing and can be adopted in relevant use-cases such as legal compliance documentation and evaluation, policy specification, consent representation and requests, taxonomy of legal terms, and annotation of text and data.</p>

<p>The DPV is an evolving vocabulary – as the DPVCG continues to work on updating it with broader concepts as well as enriching its hierarchy of concepts. For this, we invite contributions of concepts, use-cases, requirements, and applications.</p>

        </h2>
                                <p>Dataspaces gather requirements for seamless and trusted data exchange within specific domains and translate the requirements into technical specifications. 
The W3C already recommends standards for trust, interoperability, and data value. Our goal in this group is to collect scenarios from the dataspaces built by our members and manage best practices for implementing them with W3C specifications. Where those standards are not sufficient, we envision formulating questions to other community and working groups, and providing dataspace-specific normative text for specific scenarios. The Dataspaces Community Group aims to meet every year at the ESWC conference.

                                <p>Matching entities across data sources using different identifiers and formats is a pervasive issue on the web. This group revolves around developing a web API that data providers can expose, which eases the reconciliation of third-party data to their own identifiers. OpenRefine's reconciliation API is used as a starting point. Our goals are to document this existing API, share our experiences and lessons learnt from it, propose an improved protocol in the view of promoting it as a standard, and build tooling around it.

Equality is equal access, while 'equity' is equal outcomes (Antoinette Carroll, Creative Reaction Lab Founder (https://crxlab.org/)). The Equity CG will discuss approaches to creating more equitable specifications and implementations of those specifications. The group will determine whether it wants to address internal specifications (as in a self-review questionnaire before CR) or provide a tool for assessing equity (like WCAG). This will require recruiting experts in equity as well as those who reflect the diversity of the world and will take time. In time, the CG hopes to propose an Equity Horizontal Review Board (HRB).</p>

<p>This will make healthcare and medical data on web easy to describe correctly (with their correct meaning and context), easy to expose /index so ready to be accessible and will highly improve to re-usability and exchanging in semantic way, with their correct meaning and context.</p>
<p>The intention is not to replace existing ontologies, nor making upper level ontology nor creating yet another clinical information model/standards. The aim is mainly to provide most useful and frequently used (so, demand driven) classes and properties related to the medical and healthcare domain. Within this scope all concepts are mapped as far as it's feasible to the existing terminology like SNOMED CT, ICD, LOINC, ATC, RxNorm, HL7 FHIR, etc.</p>

        </h2>
                                <p>Building Web APIs seems still more an art than a science. How can we build APIs such that generic clients can easily use them? And how do we build those clients? Current APIs heavily rely on out-of-band information such as human-readable documentation and API-specific SDKs. However, this only allows for very simple and brittle clients that are hardcoded against specific APIs. Hydra, in contrast, is a set of technologies that allow to design APIs in a different manner, in a way that enables smarter clients.</p>

<p>The foundation is laid by the Hydra Core Vocabulary. It defines a number of fundamental concepts, such as hypermedia controls and collections, which allow machines to understand how to interact with an API. Since all information about the API is available in a machine-readable form, completely generic clients become possible. The Core Vocabulary is complemented by Linked Data Fragments, a set of specifications that enable advanced yet efficient client-side querying of Web APIs.</p>

<p>More information about these technologies can be found on our homepage: http://www.hydra-cg.com/</p>

        </h2>
                                <p>Information-centric networking (ICN) is an approach to architecting the future Internet around data rather than endpoints, addressing the major issues we've suffered with Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). Focusing on content over specific connections can minimize the barriers to content distribution and eliminate dependency on centralized cloud services &amp; content delivery networks. This promotes decentralization &amp; local-first computing over monopoly and consolidation, simplifies both the network stack &amp; topology, improves speed &amp; reliability with native multicast, and integrates security into all data packet transmission. </p>

<p>These properties perfectly accommodate ad-hoc networks, censorship-resistance, and the burgeoning Internet of Things (IoT). It moves infrastructure away from a delicate host-centric paradigm towards a data-centric view of accessing information securely, no matter where it may originate from. Named Data Networking (NDN) is the primary architecture and set of protocols, formed as the successor to Content Centric Networking (CCNx), and a new web is already being built upon it!</p>

<p>This group will not publish Specifications.</p>

                                <p>We choose which representations of our data to use, JSON, CSV, XML, or whatever, depending on habit, convenience, or the context we want to use that data in. On the other hand, having an interoperable generic toolchain such as that provided by XML to process data is of immense value. How do we resolve the conflicting requirements of convenience, habit, and context, and still enable a generic toolchain? Invisible XML (ixml) is a method for treating non-XML documents as if they were XML, enabling authors to write documents and data in a format they prefer while providing XML for processes that are more effective with XML content. This is an ongoing project to provide software that lets you treat any parsable format as if it were XML, without the need for markup.</p>

A list of recommended use cases will be produced by this community group.  </p>

<p>The envisioned target beneficiaries of this group are both industrial and governmental organisations who use data from building information modelling applications and other data related to the building life cycle (sensor data, GIS data, material data, geographical data, and so forth) to achieve their business processes and whom will benefit from greater integration of data and interoperability between their data sets and the wider linked data communities. For example, benefit may be obtained by publishing and combining localised data on new cheaper building materials, energy efficient building devices and systems, along with real time data on weather patterns, energy prices and geodata. By making this data available to applications, they will be better able to support decision makers during the whole of the building life cycle, which includes design, construction, commissioning, operation, retrofitting/refurbishment/reconfiguration, demolition, and recycling of buildings. </p>

<p>The group will engage with these beneficiaries through surveys and events organised in conjunction with the affiliated workshop series on Linked Data for Architecture and Construction (LDAC).

        </h2>
                                <p>In the industry of web games, there are many different web game portals across which game developers distribute their games. While these game portals all share common design patterns in their SDKs,  game developers lack a common/unified API pattern that they can target to support the various portals. Instead, developers are often forced to write their own libraries to aggregate the management of the portal’s SDKs. The mission of this Community Group is to define a Micro-API outlining a boundary between a web game and the page in which it is embedded. We propose that web game portals can simplify the lives of game developers, game engines and game portals by aligning on a minimum viable API.

                                <p>The Music Notation Community Group develops and maintains format and language specifications for notated music used by web, desktop, and mobile applications. The group aims to serve a broad range of users engaging in music-related activities involving notation, and will document these use cases.
</p>
<p>
The Community Group documents, maintains and updates the MusicXML and SMuFL (Standard Music Font Layout) specifications. The goals are to evolve the specifications to handle a broader set of use cases and technologies, including use of music notation on the web, while maximizing the existing investment in implementations of the existing MusicXML and SMuFL specifications.
</p>
<p>
The group is developing a new specification to embody this broader set of use cases and technologies, under the working title of MNX. The group is proposing the development of an additional new specification to provide a standard, machine-readable source of musical instrument data.

These lexicon models are intended to represent lexical entries containing information about how ontology elements (classes, properties, individuals etc.) are realized in multiple languages. In addition, the lexical entries contain appropriate linguistic (syntactic, morphological, semantic and pragmatic) information that constrains the usage of the entry. (2) Demonstrate the added value of representing lexica on the Semantic Web, in particularly focusing on how the use of linked data principles can allow for the re-use of existing linguistic information from resource such as WordNet. (3) Provide best practices for the use of linguistic data categories in combination with lexica. (4) Demonstrate that the creation of such lexica in combination with the semantics contained in ontologies can improve the performance of NLP tools. (5) Bring together people working on standards for representing linguistic information (syntactic, morphological, semantic and pragmatic) building on existing initiatives, and identifying collaboration tracks for the future. (6) Cater for interoperability among existing models to represent and structure linguistic information. (7) Demonstrate the added value of applications relying on the use of the combination of lexica and ontologies. </p>

                                <p>The Permanent Identifier Community Group maintains a secure, permanent UL re-direction service for the Web located at w3id.org. Web applications that deal with Linked Data often need to specify and use URLs that are very stable. They utilize services such as the one run by this community to ensure that applications using their URLs will always be re-directed to a working website. The concept operates much like a switchboard, connecting requests for information with the true location of the information on the Web. Entries in the switchboard can be reconfigured to point to a new location if the old location stops working.</p>

<p>The community is responsible for all administrative tasks associated with operating the service. The social contract between organizations involved in the community gives each of them full access to all information required to maintain and operate the website. The agreement is setup such that a number of these organizations could fail, lose interest, or become unresponsive for long periods of time without negatively affecting the operation of the site. </p>

<p> The service operates in HTTPS-only mode to ensure end-to-end security.  This means that it may be used for Linked Data applications that require high levels of security such as those found in the financial, medical, and public infrastructure sectors. </p>

<p>All identifiers associated with the service are intended to be around for as long as the Web is around. This means decades, if not centuries. If the final destination for popular identifiers used by this service fail in such a way as to be a major inconvenience or danger to the Web, the community will mirror the information for the popular identifier and setup a working redirect to restore service to the rest of the Web. </p>

                                <p>  The mission of this group is to help maintain some of the Notes originally published by the W3C Semantic Web Interest Group (now closed). This
  group will identify potential modifications to those Notes that account for changes to RDF, SPARQL, SHACL, OWL and other core standards,
  as well as the evolution of the supporting community.</p>

<p> Note: The original Notes were published with a document license that does not allow for derivative works without permission. The W3C staff
  is investigating the topic in search of an approach to enable Community Groups to evolve Specifications originally published under the
  W3C Document License.</p>

                                <p>The mission of the RDF Stream Processing Community Group (RSP) is to define a common model for producing, transmitting and continuously querying RDF Streams. This includes extensions to both RDF and SPARQL for representing streaming data, as well as their semantics. Moreover this work envisions an ecosystem of streaming and static RDF data sources whose data can be combined through standard models, languages and protocols. Complementary to related work in the area of databases, this Community Group looks at the dynamic properties of graph-based data, i.e., graphs that are produced over time and which may change their shape and data over time.

                                <p>The purpose of this group is to provide a home for the test suites and implementation reports of various Semantic Web/Linked Data specifications. After the end of a working group, the test suites often become frozen, and it is difficult to add new tests for issues that come to light later on. Similarly, some specs are implemented on a base technology, which eventually evolves (e.g. SPARQL 1.1 and RDF 1.1), and developers need access to updated tests.</p>

<p>This group will create a home for forks of the various test suites that would be appropriate to act as a redirect for existing tests. Test updates will be considered based on the consensus of those invested in the related specifications. Implementation reports can be updated as new reports are received, giving implementations visibility.</p>

<p>This group will not publish Specifications.</p>

                                <p>The aim of the Rights Automation for Market Data Community Group is to develop and publish a market-data profile for ODRL.</p>

<p>Market data is mostly the pricing and trading data for financial instruments (and their associated indices) generated by trading venues. The licenses controlling its use are frequently complex, and tightly segment the underlying data.</p>

<p>We will model these licenses using ODRL and extend the language with a profile that defines the new terms required. This group will publish Specifications.</p>

<p>With a standard, machine-readable way of describing market data licenses, we can look towards automating rights-management along the market data supply chain and drive efficiencies in financial markets.</p>

<p>The group welcomes the involvement of domain experts in licensing (especially market data) and those skilled in modeling licenses (especially using ODRL).

                Screen Capture Community Group            </a>
        </h2>
                                <h2>Background</h2>

<p>Screen capture is useful in many contexts, such as when delivering presentations, collaborating with remote colleagues, or producing local recordings. The Web Platform offers APIs to that end, allowing Web applications to capture screens, windows or tabs, and allowing the captured media to be manipulated in various productive ways.</p>

<p>The popularity of these APIs, and the ubiquity of the applications that use them, are a testament to the importance of the work that has been done thus far.</p>

<h2>Mission</h2>

<p>We believe that there is yet more untapped potential in the realm of screen capture. It is our mission to innovate further and unblock additional novel uses of screen capture, creating new business opportunities for developers and enriching the lives of users.</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>As part of this charter, the Screen capture Community Group is focusing its activities on producing new screen capture APIs and extending existing ones. APIs directly involving screen capture are in scope, as are APIs that would typically be used in tandem with screen capture.</p>

<h2>Work mode</h2>

<p>The group will conduct all of its technical work in public, on GitHub repositories, with a supporting mailing list for logistical and administrative purposes.</p>

<p>Meetings will normally be public and open to anyone to join. Should the need arise, meetings may be restricted to Community Group participants and guests invited by the group chairs. In either case, a public summary or minutes will be made available publicly.</p>

<h2>Amendments to this charter</h2>

<p>The group chairs can amend the charter.</p>

        </h2>
                                <p>Product information in the construction industry today is highly fragmented—scattered across Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs), BIM models (e.g., IFC), Product Data Templates (PDTs), CE markings, technical sheets, and sustainability labels. To support new regulatory and digital demands, this group seeks to develop shared ontologies and linked data patterns that unify such fragmented data.</p>

<p>The mission of this Community Group is therefore to define, structure, and promote future open semantic standards for digital construction product data, enabling interoperability, transparency, and automation across the construction sector.</p>

<h4>Objectives</h4>

<ul>
<li>Develop shared ontologies and data models (using OWL/RDF) for construction products</li>
<li>Align with existing classification systems and standards such as IFC, eClass, CEN/ISO</li>
<li>Create SHACL-based validation patterns for scenarios such as EPD compliance or CPR alignment</li>
<li>Provide guidance for data providers via reference implementations and example datasets</li>
<li>Enable use cases tied to DPPs, sustainability reporting, lifecycle analysis, and public procurement</li>
</ul>

<h4>Participation</h4>

<p>The group welcomes in particular participants with these interests and skills:</p>

<ul>
<li>Architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) professionals</li>
<li>Semantic web and knowledge graph developers</li>
<li>Standards bodies and regulatory authorities</li>
<li>Open data and digital transformation advocates</li>
<li>Researchers working in BIM, LCA, EPDs, DPPs, and related fields</li>
</ul>

<h4>Deliverables</h4>

<ul>
<li>Construction product ontology and linked data vocabulary</li>
<li>SHACL validation patterns for compliance and reasoning</li>
<li>Mappings to existing industrial standards (e.g., IFC, ISO 23386, ISO 22057)</li>
<li>Use-case guides, RDF example datasets, and reference implementations</li>
<li>Summary report or W3C Community Gropu Report</li>

                Semantic HTML-vocabulary Community Group            </a>
        </h2>
                                <p>The mission of this community group is to establish a draft standard for a RDF-based representation of the HTML-vocabulary. With the HTML-vocabulary in RDF, any type of an HTML-document can be meaningfully represented, generated and validated using nothing but standard semantic technologies, without any vendor lock-in. In addition, full provenance can be provided for a generated HTML-document, as every atom of the document can be described and semantically enriched, ex ante (RDF) and ex post (Rdfa). For instance, the originating algorithm that calculates a certain budget amount in a governmental HTML-document can be linked to the table cell containing the very value. HTML-documents have a wide variety of use and so has the HTML vocabulary. The HTML-vocabulary can be used to generate 100% correct HTML or xHTML and to validate this. The HTML vocabulary can be used to model the front end of a website or application, whereas the logic behind the front end can be captured in SHACL Advanced Features, making for a full semantic representation and execution of digital infrastructure, without any vendor lock-in. An HTML-document can be generated with full compliance to laws and regulations, as these norms can be linked and applied while using the HTML-vocabulary. With full provenance, an HTML-document can battle fake news and show realtime how certain sensitive data in the document (privacy, security) was derived.</p>

<p>The community group will come up with a 0.1 draft specification. This will be input for a future working group within W3C. The community group can make use of the currently available draft specification as developed by the Dutch Ministry of Finance in a working prototype for the Dutch governmental budget cycle. By starting this community group, the Dutch Ministry wants to contribute to an open source based digital infrastructure.</p>

                                <p>This group serves to promote and expand ShEx – Shape Expressions. ShEx is a grammar for RDF graphs which can be used for description, validation, parsing and transformation.</p>

<p>The Shape Expressions (ShEx) language describes RDF nodes and graph structures. A node constraint describes an RDF node (IRI, blank node or literal) and a shape describes the triples touching nodes in RDF graphs. These descriptions identify predicates and their associated cardinalities and datatypes. ShEx shapes can be used to communicate data structures associated with some process or interface, generate or validate data, or drive user interfaces.</p>

        </h2>
                                <h4>Background</h4>

<p>The utilization of data from locally connected devices has nearly become a reality, thanks to remarkable advancements over the past decade. For instance, the Web MIDI API enables bi-directional communication of MIDI messages between MIDI devices and web browser applications.
Now, with the emergence of new real-time protocols like Media over QUIC, real-time utilization of data from locally connected devices is extending beyond local clients to reach remote clients across the network. This evolution makes such data usage increasingly common on the web.
These protocol advancements enable the web to deliver orchestrated, immersive experiences that seamlessly integrate virtual and real-world elements in real time.
To fully leverage these opportunities and ensure precise reproduction of such experiences on client devices, our current focus is on timing synchronization at the sender's side, particularly synchronizing data from locally connected devices.</p>

<h4>Statement</h4>

<p>The Sync on the Web Community Group defines its mission as follows:</p><p>
1. Define the use cases that require "Sync on the Web."
2. Identify the conditions and criteria necessary to achieve "Sync on the Web."
3. Collaborate with related working groups to explore potential solutions for "Sync on the Web," including reviewing existing implementations.</p>

<h4>Out of Scope</h4>
<p>Our primary focus is to identify and define the requirements, solutions, and mechanisms for reproducing sender-side state, including all data, with precise timing and minimal jitter on the client side. As such, Synchronization of data from multiple clients falls outside the scope of this mission.</p>

        </h2>
                                <p>Much is said about the mismatch between the needs of employers for qualified employee candidates and a pool of available candidates.  One major factor contributing to this mismatch is the signaling between the demand-side (i.e., employers) and supply-side (i.e., education, training and credentialing providers, students and workers) of the talent pipeline. This mismatch frequently results in neither party coming into view of the other. The goal of the Talent Marketplace Signaling (TalentSignal) Community Group is to assist Schema.org in improving workforce signaling by refining existing schema.org types serving the talent pipeline and suggesting new types and properties where improved signaling cannot otherwise be achieved. Currently, workforce signaling sits at the intersection of a number of existing schema.org types: Course, JobPosting, Occupation, Organization, Person and the proposed EducationalOccupationalCredential.</p>
 <p>The TalentSignal Community Group will focus initially on refinement of the <a href="https://schema.org/JobPosting">JobPosting Schema</a> and related types as it survey's specifications from domain entities such as <a href="https://hropenstandards.org/">HR Open Standards</a> and <a href="http://www.pesc.org/home.html">PESC</a> as well as the US Chamber of Commerce Foundation's <a href="https://www.uschamberfoundation.org/workforce-development/JDX">Job Data Exchange (JDX)</a> and <a href="https://www.uschamberfoundation.org/t3-innovation">T3 Innovation Network</a> initiatives for better means to strong, more effective supply- and demand-side signaling.</p>

        </h2>
                                <p>Existing W3C voice interaction standards such as VoiceXML are based on use cases centered around telephony-based voice systems. The typical interaction style that these standards support is system-initiated directed dialog using grammars to constrain the speech recognizer. In recent years, interaction with voice applications has become much more flexible, with a user-initiated dialog style and significantly fewer constraints on spoken input. </p>

<p>Many of these new applications take the form of "virtual assistants". These include general-purpose assistants (for example, Siri, Cortana, Google Now and Alexa) as well as virtual assistants with specialized domain expertise. The proposed Community Group will collect new use cases for voice interaction, develop requirements for applications such as virtual assistants and explore areas for possible standardization, possibly producing specifications if appropriate. Depending on interest, this exploration could include such topics as (1) discovery of virtual assistants with specific expertise, for example a way to find a virtual assistant that can supply weather information (2) standard formats for statistical language models for speech recognizers (3) standard representations for references to common concepts such as time (4) interoperability for conversational interfaces and (5) work on dialogue management or  ‘workflow' languages . New functionality for existing voice standards can also be a topic of discussion.
Speech application developers and voice user interface designers should be particularly interested in this group.</p>

                                <p>The Web AI for Time Series (WAITS) Community Group advances real-time analysis of time-dependent data — including financial transactions, behavioral logs, and sensor streams — while ensuring the security and integrity of deployed AI models, the protection of incoming data streams, and the confidentiality of both usage and users. </p>

<p>By leveraging web-native technologies such as WebAssembly, WebGPU, WebNN, and WebRTC, the group promotes open standards for decentralized, browser-based inference on time series data, supporting both federated and edge AI scenarios. The group explores various time series AI architectures including LSTM networks, temporal transformers, and state-space models, focusing on their efficient implementation in web environments.</p>

<p>The group focuses on identifying real-world use cases, exploring architectural patterns, and drafting guidelines to support decentralized, privacy-preserving AI on time series data. As part of this effort, its initial objective is to map existing Web APIs that could serve as a foundation for time series AI workflows, while ensuring interoperability with related standards such as WebGPU, WebNN, ONNX Runtime Web, and the Generic Sensor API.</p>

<p>Special attention is given to model security mechanisms including secure model loading, runtime integrity verification, and protection against model extraction attacks. Should concrete standardization needs emerge from these efforts, the group may consider rechartering or contributing to relevant W3C Working Groups.</p>

<p>This group will publish Specifications.</p>

                                <p>Bluetooth is a standard for short-range wireless communication
between devices. This group is developing a <a href="https://webbluetoothcg.github.io/web-bluetooth/">specification
for Bluetooth APIs</a> to allow websites to communicate with devices in a secure and privacy-preserving way. In particular the web Bluetooth API focuses on minimizing the device attack surface exposed to malicious websites, possibly by removing access to some existing Bluetooth features that are hard to implement securely. Further, the API takes the approach of a user interface to
select and approve access to devices as opposed to using certification
and installation.</p>

                                <p>Media web application developers want to deploy their content on a wide and heterogeneous range of devices and platforms, e.g. televisions, set-top boxes, and mobile devices. To ensure a smooth user experience across devices, these user agents need to support a minimum set of Web technologies that developers can rely on being supported. This Community Group plans to specify such a set of Web technologies and additionally plans to provide guidance for developers and implementers e.g. on performance constraints and portability issues.</p>

<p>1) Documenting a semantic model underlying the caption formats in use, notably TTML, CEA 608/708, EBU STL, and WebVTT.</p>

<p>2) Creating a community specification for WebVTT.</p>

<p>3) Defining the mappings between WebVTT and some selected formats, including at least TTML (W3C/SMPTE), and CEA 608/708.</p>

<p>4) Creating web developer reference and tutorial material, including worked examples.</p>

<p>5) Creating a test suite and/or tools.</p>

<p>A possible transition to REC-track for some of these document(s) is envisaged and that possibility will be used to guide the work and procedures.</p>

<p>The group may produce recommendations for work in other groups, such as CSS, HTML5, and TTWG.</p>

                                <p>The Web NFC Community Group will create a Near Field Communication API that is browser-friendly
and adheres to the Web's security model. We believe that means the API will not expose full,
low level NFC functionality, but rather a higher level subset that is safe for Web pages,
protects user privacy, and does not annoy users with unnecessary or complex permission requests.

<p>Deliverables of the group may include use cases, requirements and specifications.</p>

<p>The group will collaborate with the W3C Web of Things Interest Group and Working Group to ensure any specifications complement or extend the “<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description">Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description</a>” specification.</p>

<p>Objectives:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Define a WebSocket sub-protocol for the Web of Things, using the W3C “Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description” data model and operations</li>
  <li>Define an HTTP protocol binding for the Web of Things (or support the Web of Things Working Group in defining this protocol binding and ensuring consistency with the WebSocket sub-protocol where appropriate)</li>
  <li>Evaluate other potential Web of Things protocol bindings (e.g. CoAP)</li>
